Huh.  That patch is not in Linus' tree.

Jon, could you please yank 865a1caa4b6b ("CodingStyle: Clarify and
complete chapter 7") from your linux-next branch or at least change "It
is advised to indent labels" to something less stronger?  It hasn't
even hit mainline yet and we are already getting spammed.

Looks like 9 out of 10 labels are not indented

$ git grep '^[a-z0-9]\+:' -- *.c | wc -l
27945
$ git grep '^ [a-z0-9]\+:' -- *.c | wc -l
2925

so I'd say that's a bad advise as far as consistency goes, and the
"diff -p" argument is pretty moot nowadays.

Thanks,

                Ilya
