No, not out of a hat.  Those are the results of a silly script that
runs checkpatch on every .[ch] kernel file (but not tools/) with:

	--show-types --terse --emacs --strict --no-summary --quiet -f

The magnitude of "ERRORS" is high and it's not necessary or useful
to modify old or obsolete code just to reduce that magnitude.

That's why I promote the --force option to limit using checkpatch on
files outside of staging.

Andrew? =A0Are you going to apply that one day?

Disagree.  The compiler doesn't care.  The value of consistency in
reducing defects is very hard to quantify.
