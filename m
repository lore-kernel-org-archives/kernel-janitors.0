My concern was the security implications from an integer wrap.  If
we chose ->fragment_size = 256 and ->fragments = 0x80000001 then the
size of the final buffer would only be 256 bytes.  The allocation
would succeed and it might lead to memory corruption later on.  I
haven't followed it through to verify but adding a sanity check is a
good idea.  It should probably be pushed to -stable as well.

To me it looks sort of weird to do the checking there.  Also if we
add more callers we would have to add the checking to all the
callers as well.  I can do that if you still prefer.
