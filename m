From: Colin Ian King <colin.king@canonical.com>

Shifting the 1 by exp by an int can lead to sign-extension overlow when
exp is 31 since 1 is an signed int and sign-extending this result to an
unsigned long long will set the upper 32 bits.  Fix this by shifting an
unsigned long.

Detected by cppcheck:
(warning) Shifting signed 32-bit value by 31 bits is undefined behaviour
