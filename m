It may currently be the case that the SoCs you're looking at happen to
make this clock essential but that doesn't mean that it's not going to
be different in some future SoC, nor that we can't have a software bug
that this will detect.  Being consistent with our error checking also
means that we can spot places where it might practically be a problem
more easily, it's even easier if the error checking is there first time
but it's still worth it to go back later.
