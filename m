To which messages do you refer to?

Where do you stumble on a null pointer access?

Are any improvements needed for the corresponding documentation to make it
better accessible besides the source code?

Is there a target conflict between source code understandability
and software efficiency?

You refer to another update suggestion for the software area
"staging: rtl8188eu".
Do you find adjustments for jump labels easier to accept than the simple
deletion of specific null pointer checks?

I hope that small automated changes can also help to improve affected
source files.
