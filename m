So far as I can see "hr->h.size" is set to "res_max_size" which is a
user controlled value between 12 and USHRT_MAX.  If it's larger than
sizeof(*hr), then that leads to an information leak.

I am not very familiar with this code, my other question here is that
on lines before we set "hr->h.size = sizeof(hr->h)".  It think this is
a bug.  I also think this particular code is never executed and I added
a comment to that effect.  But we do it in earlier in the function as
well:

	copy_to_user(puhr, hr, sizeof(hr->h));

It doesn't make sense to me.

Anyway, I think my patch is safe and it seems to fix a real information
leak.
