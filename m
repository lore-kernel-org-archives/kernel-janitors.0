This doesn't seem to be a complete fix for the issue.  There are several
other places where the function can fail but which don't do this cleanup
- this may indicate a problem with the automatic analysis if it fails to
spot the problem in the fixed code?

In general for this sort of issue I'd suggest considering adding the
error handling using the goto unwind block style since that tends to be
a bit more robust against forgotten error handling than adding unwind
code at each error site.  It's also a bit more managable when the code
is doing a series of allocations like this is.
