Thanks.  Architectures wouldn't matter for me, but an adjacent parsing
problem or a strangely written type name could cause a problem.  I will
check your list.

I would think though that the real problem wuld be things like the
platform_driver structure, which to my recollection has one non-constant
field, so the structure can't be const.
