On the top of CodingStyle we have
"This is a short document describing the preferred coding style for the
linux kernel."

Let's make it s/describing/& (as in "descriptive, not prescriptive")/.
The lack of consensus (in the core kernel areas) is _not_ an invitation
to pick a rule out of one's arse/nose/armpit/textbook/whatnot and stick
it as The One True Style, and references to uniformity are worthless
in such case.

In particular, "whitespace before labels" kind of patches anywhere in
VFS will be simply rejected.

IMO what we need is to go through all rules in CodingStyle and if for
some rule there is no overwhelming majority in the core kernel, well,
the list has grown way too large and could use massive trimming.
