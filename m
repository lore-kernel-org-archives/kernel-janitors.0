Yeah, I guess that's where our disagreement lies - the "so that `diff

others, all of which can be customized to your heart's content is not
a good enough reason to go from "allowed" to "advised".

Jon, ping?  My points upthread aside, both CodingStyle and
.gitattributes patches seem to be queued...
