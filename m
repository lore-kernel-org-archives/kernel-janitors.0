Well, I bet that no one specified this option, so far.  The only case
you need another address is the multiple analog joystick ports, and
the board is so rare.

IMO, this bug can be classified as the "behavior bug" to be fixed.
It's a fix for a regression that already broke user-space, after all.

So, could you rewrite the patch as a normal off-by-one fix?


thanks,
