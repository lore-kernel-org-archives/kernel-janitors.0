Yes, I see that it does that. But it's still complete shit.

Not only hotplug, you can trivially change the affinity after this
check.

Also, that preempt_disable() in there doesn't actually do anything.
Worse, preempt_disable(); for_each_cpu(); is an anti-pattern. It mixes
static_cpu_has() and boot_cpu_has() in the same bloody condition and has
a pointless ret variable.

It's shoddy code, that only works if you align the planets right. We
really shouldn't provide interfaces that are this bad.

It's correct operation is only by accident.
