That's what error means, really. When your compiler fails with an
error, you have no choice but to fix your code. Warnings on the other
hand may be ignored sometimes.

Sure. But I'm afraid you keep changing topics and I have no idea where
you are going. We started with "should there be a space before jump
labels", then out of nowhere we were discussing the wording of the
output of checkpatch (how is that related?) and now you pull statistics
out of your hat, like these numbers imply anything.

checkpatch was called checkPATCH for a reason. It's main intent was to
prevent NEW (coding-style mostly) errors from creeping into the kernel.
The fact that old code does now always follow these recommendations is
unfortunate but that doesn't make checkpatch wrong or bad.

ERROR means that the new code isn't allowed to do that. Period.
