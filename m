Yes.

At that point res_max_size is size of userspace buffer, and *hr is
effectively kernelspace buffer,  so take lowest of the two.

i.e.
    res_max_size = min(res_max_size, sizeof(*hr));

On the way "down" from here hr->h.size is available buffer size for a
response from card DSP, then on the way "up", hr->h.size is the actual
size of the response.  This value comes from DSP by DMA or IO read.

Which leads me to notice another problem in hpi6000.c, where the
response read from DSP is not limited to the given buffer size.

I will follow up with a patch in the next few days.
