There are different opinions about this implementation detail.

Does this approach look like it is affected by a "one error jump
label bug" symptom?

I have got an other impression here.

It seems that the explanations on the detail why a function tolerates
passed null pointers can also be different.

I find it still unnecessary to let a called function like "rbd_dev_destroy"
to repeat the check when you know already that the passed variable contains
a null pointer.

I would appreciate if the discussed function could be also improved by itself.
More refactoring might follow at other source code places later.

How many software developers and reviewers will care if corresponding
error handling can also become a bit more efficient?
