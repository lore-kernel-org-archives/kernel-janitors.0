What you're saying doesn't make sense.

You *can't* treat 0 as an error on Sparc because that's a valid IRQ.  In
fact, it seems like if you want to write portable code you should never
treated zero as an error.

It doesn't make sense that someone would register an IRQ resource with
an invalid IRQ number.  In other words, r->start is never going to be
zero on a platform where that's invalid.

So I'm pretty sure "if (ret < 0) " is the correct way to write code and
"if (ret <= 0) " is incorrect but generally harmless except perhaps in
limited situations on SPARC or other similar arches.
