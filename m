Please try to follow Documentation/SubmittingPatches - in particular,
you should always split unrelated changes into separate patches.  In
this case your I2C and kzalloc() changes have nothing to do with each
other and so should be in separate patches, and the kzalloc() changes
were already applied from a patch by someone else.  For the registration
changes...

...it's not clear to me that this change is an improvement - it'll make
the driver more fragile in the face of errors, I don't see a benefit in
refusing to register the variant for one bus if the other fails?
