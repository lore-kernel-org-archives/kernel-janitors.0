As far as I know, no reason exists to not just annotate mutexes; I think
mutexes just came along later and nobody happened to add the appropriate
annotations.  (Also, sparse does handle trylock.)

But yes, annotating mutexes will then introduce a giant pile of lock
warnings that need further annotation propagation.  It will also
introduce lock warnings that represent actual bugs, making it important
to not just blindly propagate annotations to make warnings go away.
