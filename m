The patch

   ASoC: sgtl5000: avoid division by zero if lo_vag is zero

has been applied to the asoc tree at

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/sound.git 

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: sgtl5000: avoid division by zero if lo_vag is zero

In the case where lo_vag <= SGTL5000_LINE_OUT_GND_BASE, lo_vag
is set to zero and later vol_quot is computed by dividing by
lo_vag causing a division by zero error.  Fix this by avoiding
a zero division and set vol_quot to zero in this specific case
so that the lowest setting for i is correctly set.
