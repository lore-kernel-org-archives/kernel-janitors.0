And they are errors, because of...?

The main intent of checkpatch these days appears to be providing an easy
way of thoughtless inflation of commit counts, everything else be damned.
Make-work, in other words.

The _only_ criterion for adding new checks should be a strong consensus in
the core kernel.  IOW, it should be descriptive, not prescriptive.  "Some
people do it this way, some - that" is not a valid reason for "let's make it
uniform; that way is just better, so from now on it's a new requirement".
Especially when the rationale behind the choice has all the intellectual
rigour of feng shui.  Some of these checks are common-sense, some are
absolutely arbitrary, there are far too many of them and elevating them
to the level of compiler errors like you seem to do is rather dishonest.
