This one is buggy.

I'm sorry, but please stop sending these.

For kfree(), at least we all know that kfree() accepts NULL pointer.
But for this one:
1) I don't know what the functions do so I have to look at the code.
2) It's in a arch that I don't compile so cscope isn't set up meaning
   it's hard to find the functions.

You're sending a lot of patches and they are all hard to review and some
of them are buggy and none of them really add any value.  It's a waste
of your time and it's a waste of my time.

dan carpenter
