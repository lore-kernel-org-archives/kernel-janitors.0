How do you think about a wording like the following?

  The functions “debugfs_remove” and “kfree” tolerate the passing
  of null pointers. Hence it is unnecessary to check such arguments
  around the calls. Thus remove the extra condition check at two places.

I find this information questionable while it is partly reasonable
according to the shown software refactoring.

Can a subject like “[PATCH] drm/amdgpu: Remove two redundant
null pointer checks” be nicer here?


Were any source code analysis tools involved for finding
these update candidates?
