From http://janitor.kernelnewbies.org/TODO:

- uninitialize static variables initialized to 0, to make it go to the .bss,
  instead of .data.
  __initdata inside functions has to be initialized, even if to 0 though.

Therefor I would go with

static unsigned int major; /* = 0 */

Let the compiler make the decision, it will make the correct one.  The
comment is just there to indicate that we haven't forgotten to initialise
it.  As soon as you explicitly initialise you force the compiler to place
it somewhere other than bss.
