If the definition of a bitmask is an identifier in all capital letters,
that would be easy.  Another possibility is such an identifier that is
defined to a value expressed beginning with 0x.  Another possibility is
such an identifier that is sometimes used with & and | and sometimes used
with an arithmetic operation.  I will give them a try.
