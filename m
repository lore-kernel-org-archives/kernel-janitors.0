It's not a matter of cycles.  My check probably takes the exact same
number of cycles as your check.  The point is that checking for negative
doesn't make any sort of sense.  If we did return an error code then we
should check it immediately after return instead of adding it to previous
return code.

The snprintf() function is documented.  It can't be changed because that
would break a ton of code as explained below.

There is no buffer overflow in these lines.  If "ret" *were* a negative
then there would be.  In that scenario we could end up copying data
before the start of the buffer because "buf - ret" could be before the
start of the buffer and we could end up copying after the end of the
buffer because "PAGE_SIZE - ret" would be larger than PAGE_SIZE.

If "PAGE_SIZE - ret" is a negative number then it triggers a
WARN_ON_ONCE() in vsnprintf().  It's not possible in this case however.
Really the original code works fine in practice because the information
we are printing out is less than PAGE_SIZE.

So my patch is effectively just a code cleanup.  If you don't apply it,
I'll probably sob into my pillow until it's wet but in the end it
doesn't matter much either way.  :P
