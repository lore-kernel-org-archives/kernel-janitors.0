I am still interested to clarify this opinion a bit more.

I am going to improve more implementation details in affected source files.

I hope that static source code analysis can help here.

Do you find the Coccinelle software also useful for your area?

Thanks for your feedback.


The suggested source code clean-up might result in a measurable effect
depending on the call frequency for the changed functions.
Can I help you in any ways to make corresponding review easier?

It can be your choice to reject my update suggestion.
