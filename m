In the beginning of last year, I received a comment from Clemens to use
'unsigned int' type for loop counter instead of 'int' type. Since then,
for ALSA firewire stack, I've been following his advice. (but actually I
missed to OXFW driver...)

For consistency inner this stack, I request you to follow this.
