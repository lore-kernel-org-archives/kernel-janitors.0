Remember that we also have to be able to read the code; it's probably
safe to assume that not everyone has the quirks of every snprintf()
implementation committed to memory.  Except for the microoptimisation
all you're doing here is making the code harder to read.

In actual fact quite a few devices have enough registers to be
truncated, meaning that it's not only possible but likely we'll exercise
the cases that deal with the end of buffer.  If snprintf() is returning
values larger than buffer size it was given we're likely to have an
issue but it seems that there's something missing in your analysis since
we're never seeing WARN_ON()s and are instead seeing the behaviour the
code is intended to give, which is to truncate the output when we run
out of space.

Could you re-check your analysis, please?
