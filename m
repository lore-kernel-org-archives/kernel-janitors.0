Oh wow!  Absolutely not.  "One Err Bugs" are one of the most common
kinds of bugs we have in the kernel.  This is where you have just one
error label and the bugs look like this:

err:
	kfree(foo->bar);
	kfree(foo);

but foo is NULL.  Mixing the error paths together it always creates
confusion.  I fix so many of these bugs...  We get a few new ones every
week.

Meanwhile Markus's error labels are absolutely useless.  They give no
indication of what going to the label does.
