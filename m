What I meant is that the original code before this "fix" was more that 7
years old and nobody ever had any issues. And that's because getting
that IRQ on that platform will simply never fail.

Also, I really doubt anybody is going to copy paste from the nuc900-ac97
driver so I'm really wondering whether it is worth fixing this non-issue.
