Note that Dan's suggestions are about the variables like "i" and "j".
These are used normally for small loop counts, and they are int in a
standard idiom.  If they are declared as another type, you force
reader's attention *unnecessarily*, and it decreases the readability
(i.e. they have to read the loop code as somewhat special even if
it's a normal loop).  This is the only big drawback, and the rest
merit/demerit are almost ignorable, IMO.

Of course, in some cases, a loop count might be better in unsigned.
But then a different variable name should be used instead.

After all, this is rather a minor issue, almost a bikeshed topic, so I
didn't care much while reviewing your patches, and I still don't care
whether this fix patch will have int or unsigned for i.  But, it'd be
good if you keep this information in your mind, at least.


thanks,

Takashi
