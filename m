Hi Jean,

... one of the main points of any coding style is consistency.  When
someone new wanting to submit say a new driver opens CodingStyle and
sees "It is advised to indent labels ...", they might start indenting
labels in their code and advise others to do the same.  Given the 9/10
existing ratio, that advice is wrong.  If I wanted to clarify the
situation, I'd have gone with "one space indented labels are also
acceptable" or so.  The example you've re-indented dates back to 2.6.4
times...

The git diff xfuncname incantation is a few years old now.  git diff
also works on regular files, BTW.

I'm not sure which patch you are talking about - the message you linked
is not a patch and it's impossible to follow large threads on lkml.org.

Thanks,
