The patch

   ASoC: cx2072x: fix integer overflow on unsigned int multiply

has been applied to the asoc tree at

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/sound.git for-5.3

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: cx2072x: fix integer overflow on unsigned int multiply

In the case where frac_div larger than 96 the result of an unsigned
multiplication overflows an unsigned int.  For example, this can
happen when the sample_rate is 192000 and pll_input is 122.  Fix
this by casing the first term of the mutiply to a u64. Also remove
the extraneous parentheses around the expression.
