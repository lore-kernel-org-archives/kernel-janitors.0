Isn't this only the case if timeout is a potentially large number? In this 
case, timeout may ultimately depend on a value that come from the user 
level, so I don't know what ranges are expected, but in many other cases 
one of the summands is a constant multiplied by HZ.  If the constant is 
small, then I guess that the likelihood that jiffies overflows and the 
likelihood that the sum overflows are essentially the same.  One then has 
to consider whether:

overflowed - correct </>/<=/>= small constant

is more or less desirable than

time_before/after/before_eq/after_eq(correct, overflowed_by_small_constant)
