IIRC, this is a kind of encoded register, so it should be never
overflow.  And looking through the current code, this encoded register
is nowhere used.  It was used only in the past in the prototype
driver.  If my quick analysis is correct, the relevant code may be
even dropped.

For now, I'm inclined to leave the stuff as is.  We may add a
WARN_ON() if this really matters.  But it's a stone age driver code,
and this particular part has never been a problem, so WARN_ON() will
be most likely nothing but a memory waste.


thanks,

Takashi
