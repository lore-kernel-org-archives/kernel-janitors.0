Not from me.

No.  A coding style issue is never a bug.

No.

No, the patch itself speaks.

If you get more reviewed-by from others, it means already it's safer
to apply.  Then I can take it.  But without that, it's obviously no
material to take.

Let's hope.

Mostly the hardware is too old, or the change itself isn't interesting
enough.

Only if it's assured to work and not to break anything else.

Learn from the past.

Can't judge unless I really see / use it.

I *hope*, but only when it's not too annoying.
