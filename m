It's worth reviewing your own patches before sending them out for
things like this (please ensure that all files are not left without
a newline at the end.)

I don't think this is going to do what you think - at least not on sane
architectures.  put_user() to kernel space is denied, even if the
location is writable to normal accesses within the kernel.

put_user() and get_user() are for accessing user supplied pointers,
which means it has built-in security to prevent userspace passing in
kernel-space pointers and using that as a way to read or modify kernel
space.

I think you want to use probe_kernel_write() here.
