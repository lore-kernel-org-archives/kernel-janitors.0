Then you're doing everything by hands, and can be wrong -- that's the
heart of the problem.  The risk is bigger than the merit by applying
the patch.

So, just prove that your patch doesn't break anything.  Doesn't matter
whether it's a test with real hardware or with systematic checks.
Once when it's confirmed, we can apply it.  A very simple rule, and
this will be valid for most of other subsystems, too.
