Really?  We have a much different memcpy() function than gcc provides
for some arches.

You want to make it painfully obvious exactly what the code is doing so
that I can fix your bugs.  And you can fix mine.  If I see two variables
being assigned to each other I'll initially assume that they are just
pointers and not care about them.  But if it's doing a 64Kb memcpy,
maybe that's not a good thing to be doing at that point in the code.

That's why I don't like these "implicit" memcpy() calls, it hides what
is going on for no good reason.

Can someone please just remove the check from the kernel as I'm getting
tired of rejecting patches that do this...

thanks,
