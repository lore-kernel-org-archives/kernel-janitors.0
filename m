This is clearly a rework and move of the existing x86 test, and not the
addition of a completely new test (see Arjan's comment about his credit
being removed...).

I would recommend that you turn this into a series that makes the x86
code generic, then moves it out into a common location where it can be
used by others. e.g.

1) make the test use put_user()
2) move the rodata_test() call and the prototype to a common location
3) move the test out to mm/ (with no changes to the file itself)

Otherwise, comments below.

As I mentioned in the original posting, you need to change to KERNEL_DS
for the put_user.

Russell's suggestion to use probe_kernel_write() is strictly better;
please do that instead.

Thanks,
Mark.
