Sorry, navigating lkml.org archive is a pain, and I was expecting to
see patch.  Your points

"The acceptance of an optional single space before labels dates back to
at least June 2007, as supported by the very first incarnation of
checkpatch.pl. So nothing really new here, except for a preference
(my preference, admittedly, but I'm know I'm not alone) being expressed
in the coding style document."

"Recommendations are not meant to document what people are currently
doing but what we think they should be doing."

are valid, but note that there is a world of difference between an
acceptance and a preference.  The *only* point of whitespace guidelines
is to keep the code base consistent.  You don't go changing whitespace
preferences in such a huge project, not unless you have a *very* good
rationale and existing code base is swayed (which it isn't, given the
9/10 ratio).

That was a 12 year old example, codifying an existing style used in
~90% cases, serving as a guideline for new contributors.

Oh, just that it works outside of git repos too, so you aren't stuck
with diffutils if you want to diff two random .c files.

This came up before: http://www.spinics.net/lists/git/msg164216.html,
Linus didn't like it.  I suggest you add him to the CC on this patch to
see if he changed his mind.

Thanks,
