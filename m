It is like for the type of anything.  If the declaration of the thing is
available with the type information, eg in the same file or an included
header file, then the type will be available.  If the declaration is not
available then the type will not be available.

One type, more that one type, it doesn't matter.

This argument is never needed.  It is only an optimization.  It means that
he header files are only considered when collecting type information, but
not whn doing transformation.  But this argument has no effect on the set
of types tha are available.
