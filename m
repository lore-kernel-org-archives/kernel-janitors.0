Subject: [PATCH][V3] of/address: check for invalid range.cpu_addr

From: Colin Ian King <colin.king@canonical.com>

Currently invalid CPU addresses are not being sanity checked resulting in
SATA setup failure on a SynQuacer SC2A11 development machine. The original
check was removed by and earlier commit, so add a sanity check back in
to avoid this regression.

Fixes: 7a8b64d17e35 ("of/address: use range parser for of_dma_get_range")

V2: print message using pr_err and don't print range.cpu_addr as it's always
    going to be OF_BAD_ADDR so the information is pointless.
V3: print the bus address to help diagnose issues
