Yeah, a fix is really needed.  But, note that this API hasn't been
used by any driver yet in the released upstream kernels, so the impact
to the real world is pretty close to null.  Thus I don't know whether
it's worth for stable kernel, too.

(The real driver implementation appears first in 3.7 kernel, BTW.)

Well, there are two issues here: the integer overflow of buffer size
and the invalid parameters.  I agree that checking the integer
overflow can be there as well in a safer side.  OTOH, the check of
invalid parameters should be added definitely.  There might be more
other places do behave more badly by such parameters even if the
values don't exceed the integer max.

So, we actually should have two distinct fixes.
