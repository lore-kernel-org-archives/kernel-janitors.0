Hi Ilya,

Thanks for adding me.

The problem isn't the documentation update nor whether you or me like a
space before labels or not. The problem is Markus Elfring. The guy just
spend his time flooding maintainers with unneeded changes they never
asked for. Ignore him and you'll be much better. If he was not flooding
you with this, he would find something else :-(

When I wrote "It is advised to indent labels with one space", I never
meant that all the existing code should be converted that way. I
expressed a preference, and provided a rationale for this preference.
After that, an advice is just that: an advice.

Your regexps are wrong ;-) but the ratio is correct.

It wasn't moot when I sent the documentation update patch. Or why would
you think it was? "git diff", by default, behaves exactly the same as
"diff -p" with regards to unindented labels (i.e. it doesn't handle
them properly.)

However, since then the issue was discussed somewhere else:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/9/5/214

As you can see, alternatives to indenting labels with one space were
found. Therefore you will soon be correct saying "the diff -p argument
is pretty moot." As soon as my patch hits mainline, actually. Which
shouldn't take too long as Andrew Morton picked it 4 days ago.

Once this happens, I'm fine with CodingStyle being updated again to
reflect the current situation.

Hope it clarifies,
