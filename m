The patch

   ASoC: qcom: storm: constify snd_soc_ops structures

has been applied to the asoc tree at

   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/sound.git 

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: qcom: storm: constify snd_soc_ops structures

Check for snd_soc_ops structures that are only stored in the ops field of a
snd_soc_dai_link structure.  This field is declared const, so snd_soc_ops
structures that have this property can be declared as const also.

The semantic patch that makes this change is as follows:
(http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/)

// <smpl>
@r disable optional_qualifier@
identifier i;
position p;
@@
static struct snd_soc_ops i@p = { ... };

@ok1@
identifier r.i;
struct snd_soc_dai_link e;
position p;
@@
e.ops = &i@p;

@ok2@
identifier r.i, e;
position p;
@@
struct snd_soc_dai_link e[] = { ..., { .ops = &i@p, }, ..., };

@bad@
position p != {r.p,ok1.p,ok2.p};
identifier r.i;
struct snd_soc_ops e;
@@
e@i@p

@depends on !bad disable optional_qualifier@
identifier r.i;
@@
static
+const
 struct snd_soc_ops i = { ... };
// </smpl>

The effect on the layout of the .o file is shown by the following output of
the size command, first before then after the transformation:

   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
   1420     512       0    1932     78c sound/soc/qcom/storm.o
