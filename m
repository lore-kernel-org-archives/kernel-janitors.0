"As usual" doesn't suffice.  It must be "almost perfect" for such a
code refactoring.  The damage by a overseen mistake is much higher
than the merit by such a patch.

If the patch is about fixing a bug, it's a different story.
Or it's about a really trivial change (e.g. your sizeof() conversion
patches), I can check and apply easily.  But for other changes with
more lines, it makes little sense.  Again, the risk of breakage
increases while the merit is negligible.

Yes, loudly.


I stop at this point, as the rest is simply a repeat from the previous
mail.


thanks,
