This PCI host is only used on one platform (ARMCORE).

For this, PHYS_OFFSET will be a value with only the top few bits of a
32-bit word set (such as 0xc0000000) - it's certainly not going to have
any bits set below bit 26 on the platform this driver gets used on.
"SZ_64M - 1" is the size of the window that RAM appears.

So, _either_ logical OR or addition works.

If we _did_ end up with a PHYS_OFFSET with bits less than bit 26 set
here, we'd have bigger problems - because the base of RAM in PCI space
will not correspond with PHYS_OFFSET and all the DMA mapping stuff breaks.
