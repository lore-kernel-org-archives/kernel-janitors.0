As far as I can tell, there'd be a lot of +'s to
change in arch/arm and only 2 uses of | in it8152.c

$ git grep -P "\(?\s*SZ_\d+[A-Z]\s*-\s*1\s*\)?\s*\|" arch/arm
arch/arm/common/it8152.c:                       *dev->dma_mask = (SZ_64M - 1) | PHYS_OFFSET;
arch/arm/common/it8152.c:               dev->coherent_dma_mask = (SZ_64M - 1) | PHYS_OFFSET;

$ git grep -P "\+\s*\(?\s*SZ_\d+[A-Z]\b\s*-\s*1\s*\)?" arch/arm | wc -l
460

I think consistently using + would make it simpler
for some possible future conversion.
