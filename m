Because it's not a bad thing?  What's wrong with an init to NULL,
a possible assignment, in this case from rbd_dev_create(), and an
unconditional rbd_dev_destroy()?

The NULL check in rbd_dev_destroy() is not a sanity check, it's
a feature.  It's not there to "fixup" callers that pass NULL - it's
there because it is _expected_ that some callers will pass NULL.

As I said in my reply to Dan, the problem with rbd_dev_probe_parent()
is the calling code which expects it to call unparent if ->parent_spec.
This makes it stand out and confuses people, but can't be fixed without
refactoring a bunch of other code.

The extra function call is *not* a problem.

Thanks,
