I think it would be better to reply individually as
the likelihood that the maintainer skips just a few
patches of a large series is relatively low.

It's more likely for a treewide or multi-subsystem
patch set for a maintainer to apply just a single one
or a selected few of the patches and individual
replies make it much easier to determine which ones
were applied.
