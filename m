The whole union member may be overwritten by a response.

Checking the size is good, but there is already a check against
res_max_size.  So, we'd rather need to check res_max_size itself
whether it's in a sane range.  The more fitting place would be at the
beginning of the function where it checks already res_max_size <
sizeof(struct hpi_response_header)).
