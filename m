You've made this statement several times over many years.
I don't believe it's true.
I doubt anyone is getting paid per commit.
Who really cares enough to game some stupid little metric?

If it's really a big deal, name some names. =A0Otherwise please
stop with this dubious argument/point.

Essentially all of the checkpatch rules are arbitrary.
The compiler doesn't care one way or another.

All the checks exist just to make code appear more consistent.

The conceit being that more consistent code is easier for humans
to read and spot potential defects and possible reuse patterns.
