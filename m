The patch

   ASoC: ak4642: make arrays fs_list and ps_list static const

has been applied to the asoc tree at

   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/sound.git 

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: ak4642: make arrays fs_list and ps_list static const

Don't populate the arrays fs_list and ps_list on the stack but make
them static const.  Makes the object code smaller:

Before:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  12084    4888      64   17036    428c sound/soc/codecs/ak4642.o

After:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  11883    5032      64   16979    4253 sound/soc/codecs/ak4642.o
