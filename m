Hi,
I was contacted recently about this privately and this was my reply:
"Checking new_nbp() and del_nbp() it should not be possible to reach that code
with p->dev or p->br as NULL. The cap check code has always been there, I just
shuffled the rest of the function to obtain rtnl lock and kept it as close to
the original as possible, thus the checks remained.
In order to avoid future reports like this I'll send a cleanup once net-next
opens up.

My reasoning of why it shouldn't be possible:
- On port add new_nbp() sets both p->dev and p->br before creating kobj/sysfs

- On port del (trickier) del_nbp() calls kobject_del() before call_rcu() to destroy
  the port which in turn calls sysfs_remove_dir() which uses kernfs_remove() which
  deactivates (shouldn't be able to open new files) and calls kernfs_drain() to drain
  current open/mmaped files in the respective dir before continuing, thus making it
  impossible to open a bridge port sysfs file with p->dev and p->br equal to NULL.
"

So I think it's safe to remove those checks altogether. It'd be nice to get a second
look over my reasoning as I might be missing something in sysfs/kernfs call path.

Thanks,
 Nik
