I am navigating through possible changes around the pattern
“Use common error handling code” mostly manually so far.

Such a possibility remains as usual.

There might be related opportunities for further improvements.
Do you trust adjustments from an evolving tool more than
my concrete contributions?

I suggest to reconsider this view.

Would you dare to follow any of the presented arguments?

Which kind of information would you find sufficient for a “prove”?

I assume that your development concerns matter more in this case.

I am curious if other contributors will become interested to confirm something.

It might occasionally look simpler than it is in “special cases”.

The response is also varying there as usual.

A few update suggestions from the discussed pattern were integrated
(also by you) already.
Would you like to continue with similar support in any ways?
