I have got an other view on such an implementation detail around
explicit SmPL specifications.

Do you assume that the Coccinelle software will handle more data type
variants for you automatically?

I imagine that there is an open issue in this SmPL approach then.
How should a return value from a function call and a variable access
work at the same place?

Do you need to distinguish source code positions a bit more with
corresponding SmPL variables?
