It's not a future proof stub.  It's just some crufty code that was
fixed over time to not leak things.  I won't defend it - it is
confusing and could definitely be improved - but that can't be done
without refactoring a fair bunch of calling code.  A patch changing
rbd_dev_probe_parent() alone just won't do it.

The caller expects rbd_dev->parent_spec to be put on any error.  Notice
that we return right away if !rbd_dev->parent_spec.

And we do, in rbd_dev_destroy(parent), since these are references for
the parent.

Yes, because as it is, ->parent_spec is a determinant of whether or not
the image has a parent.  If we fail in rbd_dev_probe_parent(), it needs
to be set to NULL to signify that the image doesn't have a parent.
Even if the entire thing was refactored, we'd still have to do the same
because not every image has a parent and the same error path has to
work for all images.  The layering violation is that we have to do in
rbd_dev_probe_parent() even though we didn't allocate it there.

We do, in rbd_dev_destroy(parent).
