Hi Ilya,

Sorry for the late answer.

Consistency is half of the reason, the other half is readability. This
is why the CodingStyle document has a number of rationales explained.
This is also why we put whitespace in the first place, while the C
language doesn't require any ;-)

The sense of my proposal was to address a readability (or usability)
issue.

I did consider the reason to be good enough to warrant a "change",
actually. Or more exactly from "one space is allowed" to "one space is
recommended." Which is quite different from changing all the code
actively. I can understand how you don't like it, but again, this
"inconsistency" has been accepted for almost a decade now, so I find it
strange to see so much resistance when someone finally tries to sort it
out.

OK, I get your point now. But the CodingStyle document isn't carved
into stone. I see 43 changes to that file in recent history (since
April 2005), some of which are actual changes or clarifications of our
coding style. This very section of the document was updated in December
2014, so not so long ago.

In the end I suppose it boils down to how problematic you consider the
current situation to be. Apparently you and several other maintainers
think it's just fine, while me (and a few others apparently) think it
is not.

Oh, I had never thought of that. Thanks for the hint :-)

Thanks for the pointer. It is interesting to see many people had been
bothered by the same problem for many years and even proposed solution
for it. But also sad to see that nothing happened :-(

Well Linus suggested to improve the default, he was not opposed to the
change per se I think. But it was 5 years ago and nothing happened
since then, so I'd rather go with what is available today. Which means
either one space before labels, or drivers in .gitattributes. Choose
your poison ;-)

Thanks,
