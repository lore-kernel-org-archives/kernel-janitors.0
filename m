This thinking is wrong, and is exactly the kind of wrong thinking that
led to the time_{before,after}{,_eq} macros. If jiffies just wrapped,
your safe subtraction will underflow, and you'll be comparing very
different unsigned values.

This is only a concern for 32bit architectures, of course. With 64bit
jiffies, even if HZ is set to 1000000 in the far future, this
civilization will still not outlive the jiffies counter (insert
shocking soundtrack!) as it will wrap in half a million years.

Sadly with 32bit jiffies it currently wraps every 50 days, and the
sign (if cast to signed) changes every 25 days.

After contemplating this for a very long time (for an NFS fix at the
time) I _think_ the magic is in the casts to signed. The construct
manages to compare correctly any given jiffie values within 2^31 of
each other (on 32bit arches) even with wraps, assuming you really have
timestamps where the second one is taken less than 2^31 jiffies after
the first.

Of course, if the highest jiffies bit wraps twice between the first
and second timestamps, you'll be comparing apples and oranges. If the
timing is right this can happen if you compare two timestamps i.e. 26
days from each other, but I think only NFS is wicked enough to produce
such long living (and stale) kernel data structures.

So in summary: don't question time_after and friends. Not without a
very good analysis and testing with a matrix of timestamps. :)

Cheers!
